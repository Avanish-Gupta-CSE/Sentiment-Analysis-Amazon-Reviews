# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Amazon-Reviews-Minor-Project
We analysed the sentiment of reviews present on Amazon through a dataset

This sentiment analysis project aims to analyze customer reviews of products on 
Amazon to gain insights into customer opinions and attitudes towards products. 
The project uses a combination of natural language processing techniques and 
machine learning algorithms to extract sentiment from textual data. The dataset 
used for the analysis is downloaded from kaggle , a well known website. It
consists of customer reviews from multiple product categories on Amazon. 


The analysis includes preprocessing the data, feature engineering, and model 
training to classify reviews into positive or negative sentiment categories. The 
project evaluates the performance of various machine learning algorithms and 
analyzes the results to gain insights into the sentiment of customers towards 
products on Amazon. The findings of this project can be useful for businesses 
and organizations to improve product quality, customer satisfaction, and sales.

## The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and consists of various columns as shown:

## Conclusion
### In conclusion, sentiment analysis is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze large volumes of text data and extract valuable insights about customer opinions and preferences. By following design and testing standards, it is possible to develop a reliable sentiment analysis model that can be deployed in real-world applications. The use of a confusion matrix and other testing metrics can help to evaluate the performance of the model and identify areas for improvement.
